# ia-case-api

Immigration &amp; Asylum case API

## Purpose

Immigration &amp; Asylum case API is a Spring Boot based application to manage cases for Immigration & Asylum Appellants and Legal Representatives.

### Prerequisites

To run the project you will need to have the following installed:

* Java 8
* Docker (optional)

For information about the software versions used to build this API and a complete list of it's dependencies see build.gradle

### Running the application

To run the API quickly use the docker helper script as follows:

```
./bin/run-in-docker.sh install
```


Alternatively, you can start the application from the current source files using Gradle as follows:

```
./gradlew clean bootRun
```

If required, to run with a low memory consumption, the following can be used:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon assemble && java -Xmx384m -jar build/libs/ia-case-*.jar
```

### Using the application

To understand if the application is working, you can call it's health endpoint:

```
curl http://localhost:8090/health
```

If the API is running, you should see this response:

```
{"status":"UP"}
```

### Running integration tests:


You can run the *integration tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew integration
```

### Running functional tests:

If the API is running (either inside a Docker container or via `gradle bootRun`) you can run the *functional tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew functional
```

In order for these tests to run successfully you will need its dependencies to be running.  Firstly, CCD will need to be running, a dockerised version of it and its dependencies along with instructions for running locally can be found at https://github.com/hmcts/ccd-docker

Secondly, the ia-case-documents-api needs to be running, this api along with instructions to run locally can be found at https://github.com/hmcts/ia-case-documents-api. 

And lastly the ia-notifications-api needs to be running.  This api along with instructions to run locally can be found at https://github.com/hmcts/ia-case-notifications-api.

To successfully interact with the above dependencies a few environment variables need to be set as below. The examples (the values below are not real, replace them with values matching those in the latest CCD Definition spreadsheet):

| Environment Variable | *Example values*  |
|----------------------|----------|
| TEST_CASEOFFICER_USERNAME  |  ia-caseofficer@example.com |
| TEST_CASEOFFICER_PASSWORD  |  password |
| TEST_JUDICIARY_USERNAME  |  ia-judiciary@example.com |
| TEST_JUDICIARY_PASSWORD  |  password |
| TEST_LAW_FIRM_A_USERNAME  |  ia-law-firm-a@example.com |
| TEST_LAW_FIRM_A_PASSWORD  |  password |
| TEST_LAW_FIRM_B_USERNAME  |  ia-system-user@example.com |
| TEST_LAW_FIRM_B_PASSWORD  |  password |
| IA_SYSTEM_USERNAME  |  ia-system-user@example.com |
| IA_SYSTEM_PASSWORD  |  password |
| IA_IDAM_CLIENT_ID  |  some-idam-client-id |
| IA_IDAM_SECRET  |  some-idam-secret |
| IA_IDAM_REDIRECT_URI  |  http://localhost:3451/oauth2redirect |
| IA_S2S_SECRET  |  some-s2s-secret |
| IA_S2S_MICROSERVICE  |  some-s2s-gateway |

If you want to run a specific scenario use this command:

```
./gradlew functional --tests CcdScenarioRunnerTest --info -Dscenario=RIA-697
```

### Running smoke tests:

If the API is running (either inside a Docker container or via `gradle bootRun`) you can run the *smoke tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew smoke
```

### Running contract or pact tests:

You can run contract or pact tests as follows:

```
./gradlew contract
```

You can then publish your pact tests locally by first running the pact docker-compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-pactbroker-compose.yml up

```

and then using it to publish your tests:

```
./gradlew pactPublish
```


### Running mutation tests tests:

If you have some time to spare, you can run the *mutation tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew pitest
```

As the project grows, these tests will take longer and longer to execute but are useful indicators of the quality of the test suite.
