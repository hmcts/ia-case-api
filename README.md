# ia-bail-case-api
Immigration &amp; Asylum Bail case API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template)

## Purpose

Immigration &amp; Asylum case API is a Spring Boot based application  for Legal Representatives to manage bail applications.

### Prerequisites

To run the project you will need to have the following installed:

* Java 17
* Docker (optional)

For information about the software versions used to build this API and a complete list of it's dependencies see build.gradle

### Running the application

To run the API quickly use the docker helper script as follows: (make sure to have the required environment variables set as under functional tests section)

```
./bin/run-in-docker.sh --clean --install
```


Alternatively, you can start the application from the current source files using Gradle as follows:

```
./gradlew clean bootRun
```

If required, to run with a low memory consumption, the following can be used:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon assemble && java -Xmx384m -jar build/libs/ia-bail-case-*.jar
```
### Using the application

To understand if the application is working, you can call it's health endpoint:

```
curl http://localhost:8686/health
```

If the API is running, you should see this response:

```
{"status":"UP"}
```

### Running integration tests:


You can run the *integration tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew integration
```

### Running functional tests:

If the API is running (either inside a Docker container or via `gradle bootRun`) you can run the *functional tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew functional
```

### Running smoke tests:

If the API is running (either inside a Docker container or via `gradle bootRun`) you can run the *smoke tests* as follows:

```
./gradlew smoke
```

### Running contract or pact tests:

You can run contract or pact tests as follows:

```
./gradlew contract
```

You can then publish your pact tests locally by first running the pact docker-compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-pactbroker-compose.yml up
```

and then using it to publish your tests:

```
./gradlew pactPublish
```


## Adding Git Conventions

### Include the git conventions.
* Make sure your git version is at least 2.9 using the `git --version` command
* Run the following command:
```
git config --local core.hooksPath .git-config/hooks
```
Once the above is done, you will be required to follow specific conventions for your commit messages and branch names.

If you violate a convention, the git error message will report clearly the convention you should follow and provide
additional information where necessary.

*Optional:*
* Install this plugin in Chrome: https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github

  It will automatically set the title for new PRs according to the first commit message, so you won't have to change it manually.

  Note that it will also alter other behaviours in GitHub. Hopefully these will also be improvements to you.

*In case of problems*

1. Get in touch with your Technical Lead and inform them, so they can adjust the git hooks accordingly
2. Instruct IntelliJ not to use Git Hooks for that commit or use git's `--no-verify` option if you are using the command-line
3. If the rare eventuality that the above is not possible, you can disable enforcement of conventions using the following command

   `git config --local --unset core.hooksPath`

   Still, you shouldn't be doing it so make sure you get in touch with a Technical Lead soon afterwards.
