        <!-- A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker
        with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API
        com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems,
        the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question
         has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers,
          we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir().
          For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory()
          which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir
          system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.-->

        False positive - https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5502

        We don't use the libraries affected by this vulnerability. This is a false positive in dependencycheck that is still current in version 8.2.1.
        Try to remove it when a dependencycheck upgrade becomes available.
        If it still happens, check that we don't use hutool-json and json-java. If we don't, extend the suppression date by another year.
