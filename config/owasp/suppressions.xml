      This vulnerability is about potential Remote Code Execution when serializing and deserializing Java classes
      using HttpInvokerServiceExport and org.springframework.remoting.
      As we don't use those constructs, we are not affected by it.
      The suppression will be a long-term one. An expiry to the suppression is kept to allow re-evaluating whether
      we're still unaffected by it.

      False positive - https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5502

      We don't use the libraries affected by this vulnerability. This is a false positive in dependencycheck that is still current in version 8.2.1.
      Try to remove it when a dependencycheck upgrade becomes available.
      If it still happens, check that we don't use hutool-json and json-java. If we don't, extend the suppression date by another year.
